        Iterates over all interception devices and creates a `Device` object for each one.
        A `Device` object represents an interception device and includes a handle to the device,
        an event that can be used to wait for input on the device, and a flag indicating whether
        the device is a keyboard or a mouse.

        The handle is created using the `create_device_handle()` method, which calls the Windows API
        function `CreateFileA()` with the appropriate parameters.

        The event is created using the Windows API function `CreateEventA()`, which creates a
        synchronization event that can be signaled when input is available on the device.

        The `is_keyboard()` method is called to determine whether the device is a keyboard or a mouse.
        This is used to set the `is_keyboard` flag on the Device object.

        The created Device objects are added to the context list and the corresponding event
        handle is added to the c_events dictionary.
